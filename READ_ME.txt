Installation
------------
The 2.3.2 version (and below) are plain old Perl programs so you can
always run it (from the command line) as:

   perl linklint-X.X.X  [parameters]

You need to have Perl installed on your system (version 5.004 or
greater).  For convenience, (on Unix) you may want to rename it to
"linklint" and move it to a directory that is on your path.

See the file INSTALL.unix or INSTALL.windows for more details.

Enjoy.
